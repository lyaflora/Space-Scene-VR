# Space-Scene-VR
 An illusious VR game in space made for my thesis project.
 #
 This game contains illusions and visual tricks.

 The goal is to find the way to move forward on the level.
 
 You know you beat the game when a counter appears.
 It means you finished the game in that amount of time.
 
## How to launch

The game is currently only available on the Oculus Go VR platform, however it is worth a try giving a chance to another VR platform as well. To play the game, simply click on

`â¬‡ Code > Download ZIP`

After downloading, you should be able to unzip and install the .apk file via ADB to your Oculus. After that, you will probably find the application in Library/Unknown sources.

## Thank you for playing!
